The One Max problem (*aka* Max One) is a very simple problem which consists on having an entire individual genes full of 1's.
For example, you have a initial population (an array) started with random genes (arrays with numbers that can be either 0 or 1), and you need to find a way to output an individual with all genes being 1.

This repository has a very simple Java code which can solve this problem.
It takes 40~120 generations to get the *onemax* individual.
